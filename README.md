# Data-Science-Portfolio
We have been learn NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn , Matplotlib , Plotly , Scikit-Learn , Machine Learning, Tensorflow , and more!

This comprehensive .ipynb python notebook will be your guide to learning how to use the power of Python to analyze data, create beautiful visualizations, and use powerful machine learning algorithms!

We'll teach using this python notebook - how to program with Python, how to create amazing data visualizations, and how to use Machine Learning with Python! Here a just a few of the topics we will be learning:

Programming with Python
NumPy with Python
Using pandas Data Frames to solve complex tasks
Use pandas to handle Excel Files
Use matplotlib and seaborn for data visualizations
Use plotly for interactive visualizations
Machine Learning with SciKit Learn, including:
Linear Regression
K Nearest Neighbors
K Means Clustering
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Natural Language Processing
Neural Nets and Deep Learning
